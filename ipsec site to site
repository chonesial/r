Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to configuring the site-to-site IPsec VPN between subnet-A and subnet-B using Ubuntu machines. 
We'll assume that you're using the StrongSwan IPsec implementation, which is popular and well-documented.

Step 1: Install StrongSwan
On both ipsecvpn-A2 and ipsecvpn-B2 machines, install StrongSwan by running the following command:

sql
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install strongswan
Step 2: Configuration Files
On ipsecvpn-A2, navigate to the StrongSwan configuration directory:

bash
Copy code
cd /etc/strongswan.d/
Create a new file called ipsecvpn-A2.conf:

Copy code
sudo nano ipsecvpn-A2.conf
Add the following configuration:

scss
Copy code
conn subnetA-subnetB
    left=ipsecvpn-A2
    leftsubnet=A1/32
    right=B1
    rightsubnet=B1/32
    authby=secret
    type=tunnel
    auto=start
On ipsecvpn-B2, navigate to the StrongSwan configuration directory:

bash
Copy code
cd /etc/strongswan.d/
Create a new file called ipsecvpn-B2.conf:

Copy code
sudo nano ipsecvpn-B2.conf
Add the following configuration:

scss
Copy code
conn subnetA-subnetB
    left=ipsecvpn-B2
    leftsubnet=B1/32
    right=A1
    rightsubnet=A1/32
    authby=secret
    type=tunnel
    auto=start
Step 3: Pre-Shared Key
On both ipsecvpn-A2 and ipsecvpn-B2, edit the IPsec secrets file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/ipsec.secrets
Add the following line:

arduino
Copy code
ipsecvpn-A2 B2 : PSK "your_pre_shared_key"
On ipsecvpn-B2, add the following line:

arduino
Copy code
ipsecvpn-B2 A2 : PSK "your_pre_shared_key"
Replace "your_pre_shared_key" with a strong and unique pre-shared key for the VPN tunnel.

Step 4: Enable IP Forwarding
On both ipsecvpn-A2 and ipsecvpn-B2, enable IP forwarding by editing the sysctl configuration file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
Uncomment the line net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 by removing the '#' at the beginning. Save the file and exit.

Apply the changes:

css
Copy code
sudo sysctl -p
Step 5: Firewall Configuration
Configure the firewall rules to allow IPsec traffic.

On ipsecvpn-A2, run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw allow 500/udp
sudo ufw allow 4500/udp
On ipsecvpn-B2, run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw allow 500/udp
sudo ufw allow 4500/udp
Step 6: Restart StrongSwan
On both ipsecvpn-A2 and ipsecvpn-B2, restart the StrongSwan service:

Copy code
sudo systemctl restart strongswan
That's it! The IPsec VPN should now be established between subnet-A and subnet-B.

Please note that this guide provides a basic configuration for a site-to-site IPsec VPN. You may need to adjust the settings based on your specific network requirements. Additionally, make sure to secure your machines, use strong passwords, and keep your software up to date to maintain a secure VPN connection.
